OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Run the Application

python chatbot.py

📝 Usage

🔒 Security Considerations

Do not hardcode API keys in your script.

Use environment variables (.env) to store sensitive information.

Ensure .gitignore includes .env to prevent accidental leaks.

🛠️ Troubleshooting

If GitHub blocks a push due to a leaked API key:

Remove the API key from the file.

Use git rebase -i HEAD~5 to remove it from commit history.

Push again with git push origin main --force.
